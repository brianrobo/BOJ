``` diff
riddle 9012
+ check the pairness
+ why stack can be applied. (I think pairness, and '+ - equal 0', if we use stack the the size will be 0, we can assume.
+ we can use just count variable instead of stack for pairness checking


riddle 10799
+ the cutted number (e.g, if cutted point are 2, the it divide it to 3 area)
+ using & push the index number to find the laser (the diffrence from previous is 1)
+ if there are several line, when laser cutted the divided count will be current line count..

riddle 1406
+ if we use array, the O(n^2), so we need another way.
+ idea is 'don't move the cursor', think leave cursor as center position
+ and move the left, right values (relative viewpoint thinking..)


riddle common
- stack has properties
- it solve most closest one by O(1)
```

## Queue
- input from one side & output in another side
- FIFO(First In First Out)
- operation
  - push
  - pop
  - front
  - back
  - empty
  - size
- impl.
  - begin idx, end idx

``` diff
+ stack has one side for io
  : top
+ queue has two side for each i / o
  : front, end

riddle imple
+ my first idea, pop & move all remain thing.
- the begin idx idea seems also same like relative viewpoint
-  I mean, front position don't need to be first in the array.
   In realtive viewpoint, I can move or You can move. (wik)
```

* [x] my simple impl.
