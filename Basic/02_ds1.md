``` diff
riddle 9012
+ check the pairness
+ why stack can be applied. (I think pairness, and '+ - equal 0', if we use stack the the size will be 0, we can assume.
+ we can use just count variable instead of stack for pairness checking


riddle 10799
+ the cutted number (e.g, if cutted point are 2, the it divide it to 3 area)
+ using & push the index number to find the laser (the diffrence from previous is 1)
+ if there are several line, when laser cutted the divided count will be current line count..

riddle 1406
+ if we use array, the O(n^2), so we need another way.
+ idea is 'don't move the cursor', think leave cursor as center position
+ and move the left, right values (relative viewpoint thinking..)


riddle common
- stack has properties
- it solve most closest one by O(1)
```
