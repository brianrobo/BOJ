## Stack
- LIFO(Last In First Out)
- operations
 - push
 - pop
 - top
 - empty
 - size

## Stack Prac

``` diff
riddle 9012
+ check the pairness
+ why stack can be applied. (I think pairness, and '+ - equal 0', if we use stack the the size will be 0, we can assume.
+ we can use just count variable instead of stack for pairness checking


riddle 10799
+ the cutted number (e.g, if cutted point are 2, the it divide it to 3 area)
+ using & push the index number to find the laser (the diffrence from previous is 1)
+ if there are several line, when laser cutted the divided count will be current line count..

riddle 1406
+ if we use array, the O(n^2), so we need another way.
+ idea is 'don't move the cursor', think leave cursor as center position
+ and move the left, right values (relative viewpoint thinking..)


riddle common
- stack has properties
- it solve most closest one by O(1)
```

## Queue
- input from one side & output in another side
- FIFO(First In First Out)
- operation
  - push
  - pop
  - front
  - back
  - empty
  - size
- impl.
  - begin idx, end idx

``` diff
+ stack has one side for i/o
  : top
+ queue has two side for each i/o
  : front, end

riddle imple
+ my first idea, pop & move all remain items.
- the begin idx idea seems also same like relative viewpoint
- I mean, front position don't need to be first in the array.
  In realtive viewpoint, I can move or You can move, both has same result. (wik)
```

* [x] my simple impl.

## Queue Prac
* [x] Josephus problem
  - <https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1158>

``` diff
riddle 1158 (josephus)
+ remove nth item in array or sequencial structure.
- when we use the queue.

- let's consider we just use the array structure..
- Think more deeply what is the teacher's riddle,
  What do they want to check for me?
```

## Deque
- Double-ended queue
- operation
  - push_front:
  - push_back
  - pop_front
  - pop_back
  - front
  - back
- There's not many problems which use deque's property.
  so skip now.


## String
- ASCII code
  - '0' => 48
  - 'A' => 65
  - 'a' => 97
  - NULL <= 0
  - We don't need to remember
    you can check by print 'A' or 'a' by with "%d" not "%c".

## String Prac
* [] lenght of string
  - <https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2743>
  - [link](https://gist.github.com/brianrobo/83cf3cdab180a5fd6a01d84bf9a0cad0)

``` c++
for (int i=0; i<strlen(s); i++) {
// Do something
}
//=> strlen is O(N)
//   so this code is O(N^2)


int len = strlen(s);
for (int i=0; i<len; i++) {
// Do something
}
//=> This code is O(N), so this is right way when you use loop with strlen()

```
### String converting
- string to integer
  - stoi: string > int
  - stol: string > long
  - stoll: string > long long
  - stof: string > float
  - stod: string > double
  - stold: string > long double
  - stoull: string > unsigned long long
- integer to string
  - use to_string fuction.
